<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

For this group project we were tasked with creating an entire process where we build different variations of rockets.
This includes building a rocket type, satellite type and engine type. Cargo can also be added on the rocket to be sent into outer space.

The 3 rockets you can build are:
* People Rocket: Falcon 9 Rocket, Crew Dragon Spacecraft with a stage 1 Merlin Engine and a stage 2 Vacuum Merlin Engine
* Satellite Rocket: Falcon Heavy Rocket, Dragon Spacecraft with satellite with a stage 1 Merlin Engine and a stage 2 Vacuum Merlin Engine
* Starlink Rocket: Falcon Heavy Rocket, Dragon Spacecraft with satellite with a stage 1 Merlin Engine and a stage 2 Vacuum Merlin Engine

These will all have different extras

### Built With

<h3>10 Design Patterns used:</h3>

* Builder
* Template Method
* Abstract Factory
* Memento
* Command
* Decorator
* Observer
* State
