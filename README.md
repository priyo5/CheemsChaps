<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

For this group project we were tasked with creating a program that builds, tests and launches different types of rockets.
This includes building a rocket type, satellite type and engine type. Cargo can also be added on the rocket to be sent into outer space.

### The poject was split into four main sub-tasks
* Asking the user for flight details (rocket types, destination planet, etc...)
* Building the users desired rocket and setting the details for the flight.
* Launching the rocket as a Simulation.
* (Potentially) Re-using the rocket for another simulation.

### 3 rockets you can build are
* People Rocket: Falcon 9 Rocket, Crew Dragon Spacecraft with a stage 1 Merlin Engine and a stage 2 Vacuum Merlin Engine
* Satellite Rocket: Falcon Heavy Rocket, Dragon Spacecraft with satellite with a stage 1 Merlin Engine and a stage 2 Vacuum Merlin Engine
* Starlink Rocket: Falcon Heavy Rocket, Dragon Spacecraft with satellite with a stage 1 Merlin Engine and a stage 2 Vacuum Merlin Engine

### Launching a simulation
* The user can contiuously modify the rocket and run static fire tests.
* Once a static fire test completes and passes, the rocket will be ready to launch.
* The launch will display the fuel remaining at regular time intervals (after cetrtain distances travelled).
* The rocket will then display whether the goods to be transported have arrived or not.

### Re-using rockets for the next simulation
* The user will be prompted to choose whether to re-use the already built rocket, create a new rocket, or the end the simulation.
* If the user chooses to re-use the rocket, then the simulation will startover with pre-set variables.

### Design Patterns used to model our system

* Builder
* Template Method
* Abstract Factory
* Memento
* Command
* Decorator
* Observer
* State
* Composite
* Chain of Responsibility

*The responsibilities of each design pattern is detailed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KPRTDBuYREFpHLTE3IBjX0e3plSBI0--/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118336233054149317239&rtpof=true&sd=true">CheemsChaps.doc</a>*

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## How to run our program

This is an example of what instructions to use to set up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

The code preferably needs to be run on a Linux or Mac operating system that has the following installed
* gcc:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install gcc
  ```

* g++:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install g++
  ```

### Installation

Here you can also see how you can clone our repo onto your machine

Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/priyo5/CheemsChaps
   ```
